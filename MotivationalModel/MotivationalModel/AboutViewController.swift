    The Enterprise Business Model app is based on the “Enterprise Business Motivation Model” (or EBMM) developed by A. Nicklas Malik and published into open source at http://motivationmodel.com .  The EBMM was inspired by a wide array of efforts in the field of Enterprise Architecture in the development and modeling of business.  These inspirations include the “Business Motivation Model” created by the Business Rules Group and published as a standard by the OMG, and many of the same source models used by Osterwalder and Pineur in developing the “Business Model Canvas”.  The EBMM differs from those models in key ways, including the ability to capture more than one model in an enterprise, and the ability to trace from customer requirements all the way through to systems, processes, and KPIs.
